# How to use this image

## Create a `Dockerfile` in your Ruby gem's project

```dockerfile
FROM ramseyinhouse/ruby-builder-2.2

COPY your-gem.gemspec /code/your-gem.gemspec
COPY lib/your-gem/version.rb /code/lib/your-gem/version.rb
COPY Gemfile /code/Gemfile
COPY Gemfile.lock /code/Gemfile.lock

RUN setup \
    && apk del .build-dependencies

COPY . /code
```

Put this file in the root of your app, next to the `Gemfile`.

This image includes the following default scripts for your convenience. They live at `/usr/local/bin`. If you want to override them, `/code/bin` is set to the front of the `PATH` to make that easy.
- setup - `bundle install`
- validate  - `bundle exec rake`
- build - Does a `gem build`, and leaves the `.gem` file in the `/code/dist/` folder inside the container. (The dist folder will not be created by this process. It must exist)

The default command is the validate script. This means you can build your image, and run your tests within the container like so:

```console
$ docker build -t your-gem .
$ docker run -it --rm your-gem
```

## Building your gem

To build your gem using the provided script:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD":/code/dist your-gem build
```
